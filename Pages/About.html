			<h2>Welcome to my About page.</h2>
			<p>I am currently both a student and employee at Bellevue College. I work in the Bookstore, so if any of you are around you should drop by and say hi!</p>
			<p>My goal is to work my way through the IT program at BC and hopefully find a career in the field</p>
			<br><br>
			<p>Q1: What was my previous knowledge of HTML/CSS/Javascript? A: Before this class, I had no knowledge of HTML, CSS or Javascript.</p>
			<p>Q2: Was my portfolio designed from scratch or did I use a template? A: My portfolio is based off of the template we used for Module04. I stripped it down, used the basic framework for my navigation bar and customized the rest to my own liking.</p>
			<p>Q3: What was the most challenging part of the portfolio? A: The most challenging part of the form portfolio was the form verification for Artifact04. I had problems with the Javascript portion, and as a result my code was not verifying the page correctly.</p>
			<p>Q4: How taking this class changed your view on Web Development? A: This class has shown me just how expansive and exciting web development is. Even though this class was just the introduction to our subject, I am excited to learn more in the future.</p>
			<p>Q5: What are your recommendations for future students? A: For future students, I recommend that they stay on top of their class work, especially in the beginning. The coursework takes some time to get accustomed to, especially if you are new to all forms of programming. Also, take advantage of every online resource you can find â€“ there is a lot of help out there!</p>
